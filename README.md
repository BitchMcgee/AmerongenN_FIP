The interface is inspired by my experience with the various main menus of video games. The games I found had the most accessible navigational system involved displaying only one thing at a time using the majority of the screen. On the side between a fourth and a third of the screen is the navigation options visibly set aside from the viewing content. I find that in cases where there is a large variety of information and options on a site, having the entirety of the options available on each screen pollutes the page and takes away from the current content.
