Student Repository for MultiMedia Authoring 3 Final Integrated Project

The interface is inspired by my experience with the various main menus of video games. The games I found had the most accessible navigational system involved displaying only one thing at a time using the majority of the screen. On the side between a fourth and a third of the screen is the navigation options visibly set aside from the viewing content. I find that in cases where there is a large variety of information and options on a site, having the entirety of the options available on each screen pollutes the page and takes away from the current content.

The site navigation works as follows:

The first page of information loaded will have the demo reel video taking up 2/3 of the screen on the right, and on the left will be the navigation menu. Currently it will show - Design, Moving Picture, Photography and About. Clicking any of these links will hide all of the current content and reduce the original nav to a single button that returns the user to the primary menu. 

Replacing this content is a list of portfolio pieces of the selected medium. One item on this list will be loaded at a time, with the first link loaded by default and each portfolio piece link clicked replacing the current viewed piece. Each portfolio piece link will have three seperate items loaded on the page: a title, the visual content (in image or animation) and the description of the piece. 

All three portfolio medium sections will present the same with the nav on the left third of the page and the viewing content taking up the rest of the space on the right. With the exception of About. For the rest, the title and description will be below the visuals but the About will have the written content in a block on the left of it, sharing the section width. The visual content for the About page will be whatever self image I have that doesn't pose the risk of breaking user's screens upon viewing it.
